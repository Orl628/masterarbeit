To do.

* Improve section on scalar multiplication on Ext^1
	- move it to a more general theory about ext section
	- start from general multiplication by elements of the global sections, with pullbacks
	- specialize to invertible scalars

* Add metadata for Hemminghaus citation.

* Replace Hemminghaus citation with own proof

* Maybe write up Grauert's Theorem and Cohomology and Base Change (low priority).

* Make sure the locus where V_k is of general type is not empty.

* Abbreviate "Lefschetz pencil"

* Substitute the d_i with b_i

* Introduce coordinates s,t for P^1.

-----SECOND DRAFT-----

* On page 3, use maybe that Ext(F,G) = H^1(X,F\dual \otimes G) for F locally free, and then that we have the usual base change theorems. (\ref{prop:ext-base-change})

* Explain notation \boxtimes

* Props. 1.4. und 1.5.: add reference, or cut. E.g. cut prop. 1.4.

* Clarify scheme language, remove the rational points.
