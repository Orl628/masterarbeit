To do.

* Improve section on scalar multiplication on Ext^1
	- move it to a more general theory about ext section
	- start from general multiplication by elements of the global sections, with pullbacks
	- specialize to invertible scalars

* Add metadata for Hemminghaus citation.

* Replace Hemminghaus citation with own proof

* Maybe write up Grauert's Theorem and Cohomology and Base Change (low priority).

* Make sure the locus where V_k is of general type is not empty.

* Abbreviate "Lefschetz pencil"
