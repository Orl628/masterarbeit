\section{Loci of Types in the Grassmannian}

In this section, we study the subsets of the grassmannian of lines in $\schemeofsurfaces$ corresponding to the different splitting types for $V_k$. For this section, let $d\leq k < 2d$, so that the generic splitting type is surely attained. We focus on the generic splitting type and the complement of its corresponding set in the Grassmannian, the set of jumping lines. As expected, the set corresponding to the generic splitting type is an open dense subset of the Grassmannian, and the other loci are locally closed. For $k=d+1$, and $n=3$ we describe the cohomology class of the set of jumping lines in terms of Schubert cells.
